<h1>The Best Movies According to Amy!</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>I count the whole series as one movie and you cannot tell me differently</p>
<h3>Pitch Perfect</h3>
<p>This is another "movie" where I count all three in the series as one film.</p>
<h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p>This is probably hands down my favourite film of all time. Mr. Darcy, yes please. </p>
